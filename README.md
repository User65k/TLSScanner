An implementation of a passive TLS security scanner based on the one from [tintinweb/scapy-ssl_tls/examples/security_scanner](https://github.com/tintinweb/scapy-ssl_tls/blob/master/examples/security_scanner.py).

[scapy-ssl_tls](https://github.com/tintinweb/scapy-ssl_tls) seems to be dead and scapy has now its own TLS implementation anyway.

Only checks the client handshake for now.
